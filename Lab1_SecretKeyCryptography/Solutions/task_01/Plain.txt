LED THE CRITIQUE OF PRACTICAL REASON, NOT OF THEPURE PRACTICAL REASON, ALTHOUGH ITS PARALLELISM WITH THE SPECULATIVECRITIQUE WOULD SEEM TO REQUIRE THE LATTER TERM. THE REASON OF THISAPPEARS SUFFICIENTLY FROM THE TREATISE ITSELF. ITS BUSINESS IS TO SHOWTHAT THERE IS PURE PRACTICAL REASON, AND FOR THIS PURPOSE ITCRITICIZES THE ENTIRE PRACTICAL FACULTY OF REASON. IF IT SUCCEEDS INTHIS, IT HAS NO NEED TO CRITICIZE THE PURE FACULTY ITSELF IN ORDERTO SEE WHETHER REASON IN MAKING SUCH A CLAIM DOES NOT PRESUMPTUOUSLYOVERSTEP ITSELF (AS IS THE CASE WITH THE SPECULATIVE REASON). FORIF, AS PURE REASON, IT IS ACTUALLY PRACTICAL, IT PROVES ITS OWNREALITY AND THAT OF ITS CONCEPTS BY FACT, AND ALL DISPUTATIONAGAINST THE POSSIBILITY OF ITS BEING REAL IS FUTILE.WITH THIS FACULTY, TRANSCENDENTAL FREEDOM IS ALSO ESTABLISHED;FREEDOM, NAMELY, IN THAT ABSOLUTE SENSE IN WHICH SPECULATIVE REASONREQUIRED IT IN ITS USE OF THE CONCEPT OF CAUSALITY IN ORDER TOESCAPE THE ANTINOMY INTO WHICH IT INEVITABLY FALLS, WHEN IN THECHAIN OF CAUSE AND EFFECT IT TRIES TO THINK THE UNCONDITIONED.SPECULATIVE REASON COULD ONLY EXHIBIT THIS CONCEPT (OF FREEDOM)PROBLEMATICALLY AS NOT IMPOSSIBLE TO THOUGHT, WITHOUT ASSURING ITANY OBJECTIVE REALITY, AND MERELY LEST THE SUPPOSED IMPOSSIBILITY OFWHAT IT MUST AT LEAST ALLOW TO BE THINKABLE SHOULD ENDANGER ITS VERYBEING AND PLUNGE IT INTO AN ABYSS OF SCEPTICISM.INASMUCH AS THE REALITY OF THE CONCEPT OF FREEDOM IS PROVED BY ANAPODEICTIC LAW OF PRACTICAL REASON, IT IS THE KEYSTONE OF THE WHOLESYSTEM OF PURE REASON, EVEN THE SPECULATIVE, AND ALL OTHER CONCEPTS(THOSE OF GOD AND IMMORTALITY) WHICH, AS BEING MERE IDEAS, REMAIN INIT UNSUPPORTED, NOW ATTACH THEMSELVES TO THIS CONCEPT, AND BY ITOBTAIN CONSISTENCE AND OBJECTIVE REALITY; THAT IS TO SAY, THEIRPOSSIBILITY IS PROVED BY THE FACT THAT FREEDOM ACTUALLY EXISTS, FORTHIS IDEA IS REVEALED BY THE MORAL LAW.
